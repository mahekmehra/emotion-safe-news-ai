# Emotion-Aware GenAI Media Guard 🧠✨


An ethical Generative AI system that detects emotionally manipulative content, explains its psychological impact, and rewrites it into a mentally safe, neutral form — helping protect users from fear-based and anxiety-inducing media.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Digital media and social platforms increasingly use emotionally manipulative language that amplifies fear, panic, and anxiety, negatively affecting public mental health and decision-making.

There is no accessible system today that:
- Detects emotional manipulation
- Explains why content is harmful
- Actively rewrites it in a safe, calm manner

---

## 💡 Solution

Emotion-Aware GenAI Media Guard uses NLP and Generative AI to:

- Detect dominant emotions in content
- Quantify emotional manipulation risk
- Explain psychological impact in human terms
- Rewrite content into a neutral, educational, or reassuring tone
- Visually validate emotional harm reduction

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- Emotion detection using transformer models
- Mental health risk scoring & categorization
- Explainable AI (why the content is harmful)
- GenAI-powered neutral rewriting
- Before vs after emotion comparison graphs
- Ethical & human-centered AI design

## 🧪 Current Status

**Phase 1 — Backend Core (Completed)**  
Backend APIs are fully operational with live GenAI integration, including emotion detection, mental health risk scoring, explainable analysis, and neutral content rewriting. API endpoints are stable and documented via Swagger.

**Phase 2 — Explainability & Mental Health Intelligence (Completed)**  
Emotion-triggering language is identified and highlighted, mental health risk levels are mapped to human-readable badges, and explainable AI metadata is returned to support transparency and responsible interpretation.

**Phase 3 — Advanced NLP & Scalability (Completed)**  
Tone-conditioned GenAI rewriting, URL-based news analysis, and batch processing capabilities are implemented, enabling scalable and real-world content analysis workflows.

**Next Phase**  
Phase 4 will focus on building a professional frontend interface and integrating the backend APIs into a user-facing application.

## 🎯 Why This Project Stands Out

- Ethical & responsible GenAI usage
- Mental health–focused AI design
- Explainability-first approach
- Quantitative validation of GenAI impact
- Production-ready architecture
