# Emotion-Aware GenAI Media Guard 🧠✨

An ethical Generative AI system that detects emotionally manipulative content, explains its psychological impact, and rewrites it into a mentally safe, neutral form — helping protect users from fear-based and anxiety-inducing media.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Digital media and social platforms increasingly use emotionally manipulative language that amplifies fear, panic, and anxiety, negatively affecting public mental health and decision-making.

There is no accessible system today that:
- Detects emotional manipulation
- Explains why content is harmful
- Actively rewrites it in a safe, calm manner

---

## 💡 Solution

Emotion-Aware GenAI Media Guard uses NLP and Generative AI to:

- Detect dominant emotions in content
- Quantify emotional manipulation risk
- Explain psychological impact in human terms
- Rewrite content into a neutral, educational, or reassuring tone
- Visually validate emotional harm reduction

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- Emotion detection using transformer models
- Mental health risk scoring & categorization
- Explainable AI (why the content is harmful)
- GenAI-powered neutral rewriting
- Before vs after emotion comparison graphs
- Ethical & human-centered AI design
